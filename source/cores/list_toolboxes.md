# Related Heterogenous Agent Toolkits

The field of quantitative heterogeneous-agent modeling is fortunate to have a diverse selection of exceptional toolboxes and code templates. These valuable resources offer a range of model specializations, programming languages, algorithms, and user interfaces. Here's an incomplete list of these tools (and please share yours if they're not included!):

- Discrete Time Heterogeneous Agent Models

    - [GDSGE](http://gdsge.com)

    - [Econ-ARK](https://econ-ark.org/)

    - [The Paper and Toolkit by Thomas Winberry](https://www.thomaswinberry.com/research/index.html)

    - [Sequence Space Jacobian](https://github.com/shade-econ/sequence-jacobian)

    - [BASEforHANK](https://github.com/BASEforHANK)

- Continuous Time Heterogeneous Agent Models

    - [The Collection of Codes by Benjamin Moll](https://benjaminmoll.com/codes/)

    - [PHACT](https://github.com/gregkaplan/phact)

Following [Dynare](https://www.dynare.org/) and project [GDSGE](http://gdsge.com), we've embraced an automatic code generation strategy based on a model script file. This approach complements existing toolkits that emphasize code templates and supporting functions for model solutions. We believe our method offers a valuable addition to the researcher's toolkit, and we're excited to collaborate with the community to enhance the capabilities within the field of heterogeneous-agent modeling.
